## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm LuÃ­s, a Software Developer with focus on the web platform and cross-platform mobile app development. I work mostly with PHP (Yii, Zend, Codeigniter, Laravel), Ionic and Angular making robust high end web apps, and hybrid mobile apps with native-quality. 

I'm currently working on the Web Team [@e-goi](https://www.e-goi.com) making landing pages great again.
